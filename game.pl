% Use this as the starting point for your game.  This starter code includes
% the following:
%  - Two example areas
%  - An example of how you might connect those areas
%  - Handling of the actions 'go _______.', 'help.', and 'quit.'
%  - Basic input processing which strips punctuation and puts the words into a list

% Use this dynamic fact to store the player's current location
:- dynamic current_area/1.

% Here is one way you might create your areas
area(exampleArea1, 'First Area', 'You find yourself in a simple example area').
area(exampleArea2, 'Second Area', 'You look around and find yourself in a an area...full of nothing').

% You might connect those areas like this:
connected(north, exampleArea1, exampleArea2).
connected(south, exampleArea2, exampleArea1).

% This rule starts everything off
